## How to use these slides

- ``<space>`` : go to the next slide
- ``<shift+space>``: go back
- ``<left right up down arrows>``: navigate through the presentation structure
- ``<esc>``: toggle overview mode

## Motivation

- Glaciers allow people to perceive slow changes of the climate system
  that would otherwise be superimposed by short-term noise  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Glacier melt increases risks and geohazards  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- Shrinking glaciers are an icon of climate change  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Problem: <br> glaciers are complex!

Quote from Marzeion et al., 2012:

_"Glaciers are natural low-pass filters of the climate system..."_

_"... but the filter comes without a manual."_  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Hack

- create an educational and reactive web application showing the impact of
  climate change on glaciers

----

## Data

- Glaciers extent data from the Randolph Glacier Inventory
- ERA-Interim / ERA-5
- When available (soon?): CMIP + PMIP + much more?

----

## Tools

- Science: [Open Global Glacier Model](http://oggm.org)
- Visualization: [Dash+Plotly](https://plot.ly/products/dash/)
- Maps: [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com/)

---

## Use case 1: <br> world glacier explorer

- Learn where glaciers are located and why
- https://dash.klima.uni-bremen.de/apps/explore

----

## Use case 2: <br> climate scenarios

- Glacier change under various projections
- https://dash.klima.uni-bremen.de/apps/scenarios

----

## Use case 3: <br> geometry changes

- Glacier geometry change
- https://dash.klima.uni-bremen.de/apps/geometry
