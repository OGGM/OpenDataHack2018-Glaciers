## Problem

- Glaciers allow people to perceive slow changes of the climate system
  that would otherwise be superimposed by short-term noise  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- shrinking glaciers are an icon of climate change  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
- glaciers are complex! <br> "The low-pass filter comes without a manual"  <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

## Hack

- create an educational and reactive web application showing the impact of
  climate change on glaciers
